      <p style="margin-left: 100px">&ndash; "I have found the way", just like little Knuckles here. I have learned how to find information to build simple sites. I also learned how to use data repositories, like GitHub, CodePen, etc. I also learned how great it is having a helpful comunity (e.g., Slack - thanks everyone for the help and support)!</p>

      <p><ul><li><b>What has been easy?</b></li></ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px">&ndash; I think everying was challenging... I don't program as often as I used to (e.g., microcontroller systems). But my previous programing knowledge has been very helpful! Also, keeping up my spirit by listening to motivation songs, like <i>Hamilton's</i>, "Non-Stop" and getting help from the Slack community has helped me persevere!</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 100px">&ndash; Honestly, using Slack has been painful and I got these errors saying I need to by the "Pro" version to see past messages... But trying my best to learn as fast as I can! </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 100px">&ndash; I try my best to find the knowledge from the web. Taking notes and giving credit whenever possible. But if I am really stuck, I look for help in the Slack community, which has been awesome!</p>
