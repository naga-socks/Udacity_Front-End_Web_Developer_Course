  <title>Writing Selectors Exercise</title>
  <!-- Remember that ids should reflect only a single element, while classes can be used over and over again.

Purpose notes

Selectors . and #
. = The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute

# = The #id selector styles the element with the specified id.

In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

review
ID = local variable declariation
. = specific variable declaration
